        "1. **Definition**: Sentiment analysis is a computational technique in natural language processing (NLP) that identifies and categorizes opinions or emotions within text data to determine the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, or service.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Applications**: It's widely used in business and marketing for brand monitoring, product reviews analysis, customer feedback, and social media monitoring, helping organizations understand consumer sentiments and preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Techniques and Challenges**: Sentiment analysis often employs machine learning, lexical methods, or a combination of both. It faces challenges like detecting sarcasm, context, cultural variations, and nuanced expressions of emotions."
